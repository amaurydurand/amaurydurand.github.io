I am a second-year PhD student in the [Image, Data, Signal](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/the-school/teaching-research-departments/image-data-signal) department at [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home) under the supervision of [François Roueff](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/roueff/) and in the TREE department at [EDF R&D](https://www.edf.fr/en/the-edf-group/who-we-are/activities/research-and-development) under the supervision of Jean-Marc Jicquel and Nicolas Paul. My research focuses on Functional Data Analysis and its applications to electrical load monitoring. 

I graduated in 2018 from [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home) and the [StatML](https://master-statml.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/) master of [Université Paris Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en) with a major in Statistics and Machine Learning.
